# Amazing Authentication Rails Starter

Hello! We are excited to talk with you more soon :)

This is a basic Rails app that satisfies the base case for the Grailed pairing interview:
> Let's create a web server that can accept HTTP requests on port `3000`.
> When I make a `GET` request to `/` I see a message that says `"Hello dear world"`.

Before you come for your interview, please make sure that you can run this app locally on your machine. We will be building on top of it. Reference the [Rails guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) if it's helpful!

Let us know if you have any questions in the meantime!
